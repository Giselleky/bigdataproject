  An abstract is a self-contained, short, and powerful statement that describes a larger work. Components vary according to discipline. An abstract of a social science or scientific work may contain the scope, purpose, results, and contents of the work. An abstract of a humanities work may contain the thesis, background, and conclusion of the larger work. An abstract is not a review, nor does it evaluate the work being abstracted.  s

# what we need to do:
Description of data and preliminary data preparation:
Source of data: Freddie Mac, The Federal Home Loan Mortage Corp. (FHLMC). A government sponsored corporation that buys mortages and packages them into mortage-backed securities. (How they collect the data?) (What is the data about?)

Description of major attributes (variables): Total of 26 variables in the original data set. And a total of 24 variables in the monthly data set. 
(What are the variables exactly, categorical or numerical?)
(What are the variables about?)

Quality of the data: 
-Many N/A values in the monthly data. (Eg: Repurchase flag and zero-balance code-there are only available when the loan age ends.)
- Some of the values are coded in a way that we will not know about the exact value of the variable. (Eg: Credit score--below 301:space, above 850:space), poses problems. Some of the variables are unknown too.
